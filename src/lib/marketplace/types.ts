// Marketplace layer — the Unified Product Data Layer. This module knows how
// to talk to real marketplaces; the AI intelligence engine (src/lib/engine)
// never imports a specific provider, only the generic ProductListing type
// and `searchAllMarketplaces`/`searchAllMarketplaces` from ./registry.
// Adding a new marketplace means implementing MarketplaceProvider and
// registering it in registry.ts; nothing else in the app changes — SerpAPI,
// Amazon PA-API, Mercado Libre, eBay, Keepa, Walmart are all just
// interchangeable implementations of the same interface, never a hardcoded
// dependency of the scoring engine.

// The single normalized shape every provider maps its raw data into. `seller`
// and `condition` are kept beyond the marketplace's own product-identity
// fields because they're real scoring inputs downstream (trust/return-risk,
// margin), not because every provider populates them.
